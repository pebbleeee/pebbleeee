## 🐠 About Me  
When I’m not coding, I’m either weightlifting at the gym or setting up aquascapes—creating balance in both tanks and code. I approach software like an ecosystem: structure, flow, adaptability. 🐡🐟🐠

## 🐟 Aquarium Metaphor  
I see my GitHub as an aquarium: My projects are the fish, tools are the plants and rocks, and commits are the water changes that keep it alive. Harmony matters. 🐡🐠🐟
