## 🐠 About Me  
When I’m not coding, I’m either weightlifting at the gym or setting up aquascapes—creating balance in both tanks and code. I approach software like an ecosystem: structure, flow, adaptability. 🐡🐟🐠

## 🐡 Highlighted Projects
- **CUDA N-body Simulation & Renderer** — optimized from O(n²) to O(n) using Barnes-Hut on GPU, ensured atomic correctness for accurate GPU rendering, implemented collision heat mapping to color particles by collision force simulating planetary core heating 🐟  
- **Fraud Detection Pipeline** — ANN + RNN on transaction data with SMOTE & ROC/F1 metrics 🐠  
- **Qt-VTK Visualization App** — interactive 2D/3D vector field visualizations (arrows, streamlines, LIC) 🐡  
- **Full-Stack Web Apps** — end-to-end React, Node.js, PostgreSQL solutions 🐟

## 🐠 Aquarium Metaphor  
I see my GitHub as an aquarium: My projects are the fish, tools are the plants and rocks, and commits are the water changes that keep it alive. Harmony matters. 🐡🐠🐟
